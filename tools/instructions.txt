I have attached a file with practice questions and answers for the US bar exam (MBE).  I want you to extract each question as a new entry in my sample schema (and potentially as groups of questions too).  Please reflow the text without adding newlines unnecessarily.  Only use newlines (\n) in the text for new paragraphs and spacing where it makes sense, not to match the formatting of the PDF.  For any inapplicable fields, just list null.  If an explanation is not provided, please add in your own explanation but put an optional ai_generated flag in the answer.  Do not number the questions in question_text, or label the answer choices with A, B, C, or D.  My interface will handle that.
The 7 possible "categories" are "Contracts and Sales", "Constitutional Law", "Criminal Law and Procedure", "Civil Procedure", "Evidence", "Real Property" and "Torts".  Please select only from these categories.  Category notes should always be "" (an empty string), while the subcategories will depend on which category was selected.  From there, please following the following dictionary to choose a subcategory appropriate to the category you selected.

Here's a summary of the project I want help with. My main goal is to create a robust single page web app (HTML and JS only) that I can use to build a quiz application for studying for the US bar exam. I need to compile practice questions from various sources I have, like official past exams and materials from providers such as Barbri, into this single JSON format.
The JSON schema needs to capture all the essential details for each multiple-choice question. This includes the question_id, the question_text, the legal category (like Torts), the choices (A, B, C, D), the answer object specifying the correct_choice and providing a detailed explanation, and information about the question's source (provider, year, etc.).  If an explanation is not provided, an AI generated explanation is added and the optional ai_generated flag is set to true.
An important feature I need is the ability to handle groups of questions that are based on a common fact pattern, which is common in bar exams. So, the schema includes a groups list where each group has an ID, potentially some common text (ignore the intro_text), and a defined question_order. Back in the main questions list, each question object has a group_id field that links it to the relevant group, or is null if it's a standalone question. This setup ensures these related questions stay together in the right sequence, preserving the necessary context.
Finally, a critical part of this system is tracking my own performance as I use the quiz app. For each question, the schema uses a user_attempts list. Every time I answer a question, a new entry should be added to this list recording my chosen_answer, the time_submitted, the time_spent_seconds for that attempt, and any notes I add. This detailed tracking is vital because it will allow me to analyze my progress, see which questions or topics are giving me trouble, monitor my speed, and review my thinking process for past attempts.
This is the sample schema for you:
